My goal with this project is to reimagine how we look at biology. With the advent of technology, machine learning, and AI, I want to harness this power to better understand biology, genomics, and my ultimate goal .... cancer. Through this series of projects, my aim is to develop cutting-edge tools that shed light on the nuances of genomics in ways that were not possible before.

This specific project aims to visualize human chromosome I along with various biological properties and physical attributes. It also calculates the Chromosome Surface Accessible Area around the chromosome to better understand the open/closed regions in the genome and how they relate to various biological functions and gene expression.

**Chromosome Surface Accessible Area:** an algorithm derived from the protein *Solvent Accessible Surface Area*, implemented in a way to study open chromatin — a proposed alternative to ATAC-Seq.

**Built With:** Python, Polars, NumPy, Three.js, TypeScript, Vite
